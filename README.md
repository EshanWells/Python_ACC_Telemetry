# Python_ACC_Telemetry

This program displays telemetry for the Assetto Corsa Competizone game. 

ACCSharedMemoryRelay will pull data from shared memory and format into classes. Hard. maybe do classes as arrays.
Server will pass data magically to Client. Probably sockets.
Frontend can display data. Might use PyQt for that to do some nice stuff. Could even use Js or Java or something not shite
